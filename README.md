# Harver_Exercise
This repository is created for the Harver Exercise

Improvements made in the code:

   Replaced the destructuring import for fs and path with regular imports for better clarity.
   Used console.error instead of console.log for error logging.
   Encoded the dynamic parts of the URLs using encodeURIComponent to ensure proper URL formatting.
   Used Buffer.from instead of the deprecated new Buffer for creating buffers from binary data.
   Added explicit type annotation ('image/jpeg') when getting the image buffer.
   Used console.log to display the error message if an error occurs during file saving.
   Removed unnecessary comments to keep the code clean and concise.
   Used template literals for string interpolation to improve readability.
   Followed consistent indentation and code style.
